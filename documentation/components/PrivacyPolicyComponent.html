    &lt;h3&gt;Retention of Your Personal Data&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The Company will retain Your Personal Data only for as long as is
      necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain
      and use Your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with our
      legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to
      comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal
      agreements and policies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The Company will also retain Usage Data for internal analysis purposes.
      Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when
      this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the

      data for longer time periods.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Transfer of Your Personal Data&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Your information, including Personal Data, is processed at the Company&#x27;s
      operating offices and in any other places where the parties involved in
      the processing are located. It means that this information may be
      transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of Your
      state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the data
      protection laws may differ than those from Your jurisdiction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by Your submission of such
      information represents Your agreement to that transfer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Your
      data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no
      transfer of Your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a
      country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security
      of Your data and other personal information.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Delete Your Personal Data&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      You have the right to delete or request that We assist in deleting the
      Personal Data that We have collected about You.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Our Service may give You the ability to delete certain information about
      You from within the Service.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      You may update, amend, or delete Your information at any time by signing

      section that allows you to manage Your personal information. You may also
      contact Us to request access to, correct, or delete any personal
      information that You have provided to Us.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Please note, however, that We may need to retain certain information when
      we have a legal obligation or lawful basis to do so.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Disclosure of Your Personal Data&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Business Transactions&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      If the Company is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, Your
      Personal Data may be transferred. We will provide notice before Your
      Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy
      Policy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Law enforcement&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose Your
      Personal Data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests
      by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government agency).
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Other legal requirements&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The Company may disclose Your Personal Data in the good faith belief that
      such action is necessary to:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Comply with a legal obligation&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;

        Service
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Protect against legal liability&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Security of Your Personal Data&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that
      no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
      storage is 100% secure. While We strive to use commercially acceptable
      means to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its absolute
      security.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Children&#x27;s Privacy&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not
      knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under
      the age of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and You are aware that Your
      child has provided Us with Personal Data, please contact Us. If We become
      aware that We have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13
      without verification of parental consent, We take steps to remove that
      information from Our servers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your
      information and Your country requires consent from a parent, We may
      require Your parent&#x27;s consent before We collect and use that information.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Links to Other Websites&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      Our Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by
      Us. If You click on a third party link, You will be directed to that third
      party&#x27;s site. We strongly advise You to review the Privacy Policy of every
      site You visit.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
      privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Changes to this Privacy Policy&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify You of
      any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;

      prior to the change becoming effective and update the &quot;Last updated&quot; date
      at the top of this Privacy Policy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any
      changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted
      on this page.
